HOW COULD HE KNOW THIS NEW DAWN’S LIGHT
WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER?
SET SAIL TO SEA, BUT PULLED OFF COURSE
BY THE LIGHT OF GOLDEN TREASURE

WAS HE THE ONE CAUSING PAIN
WITH HIS CARELESS DREAMING?
BEEN AFRAID, ALWAYS AFRAID,
OF THE THINGS HE’S FEELING

HE COULD JUST BE GONE
HE WOULD JUST SAIL ON
HE’LL JUST SAIL ON
