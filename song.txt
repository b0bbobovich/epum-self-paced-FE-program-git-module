HOW COULD HE KNOW THIS NEW DAWN’S LIGHT
WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER?
SET SAIL TO SEA, BUT PULLED OFF COURSE
BY THE LIGHT OF GOLDEN TREASURE

WAS HE THE ONE CAUSING PAIN
WITH HIS CARELESS DREAMING?
BEEN AFRAID, ALWAYS AFRAID,
OF THE THINGS HE’S FEELING

HE COULD JUST BE GONE
HE WOULD JUST SAIL ON
HE’LL JUST SAIL ON


HOW CAN I BE LOST, IF I’VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO?
SEARCH FOR SEAS OF GOLD,
HOW COME IT’S GOT SO COLD?

HOW CAN I BE LOST? IN REMEMBRANCE I RELIVE
AND HOW CAN I BLAME YOU,
WHEN IT’S ME I CAN’T FORGIVE?


THESE DAYS DRIFT ON INSIDE A FOG
THICK AND SUFFOCATING
HIS SINKING LIFE, OUTSIDE ITS HELL
INSIDE, INTOXICATING

HE’S RUN AGROUND LIKE HIS LIFE,
WATER MUCH TOO SHALLOW
SLIPPING FAST, DOWN WITH HIS SHIP,
FADING IN THE SHADOWS

NOW A CASTAWAY
THEY’VE ALL GONE AWAY
THEY’VE GONE AWAY
