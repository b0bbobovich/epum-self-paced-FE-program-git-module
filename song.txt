HOW COULD HE KNOW THIS NEW DAWN’S LIGHT
WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE FOREVER?
SET SAIL TO SEA, BUT PULLED OFF COURSE
BY THE LIGHT OF GOLDEN TREASURE

WAS HE THE ONE CAUSING PAIN
WITH HIS CARELESS DREAMING?
BEEN AFRAID, ALWAYS AFRAID,
OF THE THINGS HE’S FEELING

HE COULD JUST BE GONE
HE WOULD JUST SAIL ON
HE’LL JUST SAIL ON


HOW CAN I BE LOST, IF I’VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO?
SEARCH FOR SEAS OF GOLD,
HOW COME IT’S GOT SO COLD?

HOW CAN I BE LOST? IN REMEMBRANCE I RELIVE
AND HOW CAN I BLAME YOU,
WHEN IT’S ME I CAN’T FORGIVE?
